        <h2>Our Business Story</h2>
        <p>Coffee house company is a successfully expanding chain of coffee shops in the Armenian market, with an endeavor to grow globally. We take pride in being the largest takeaway chain of coffee shops functioning in Armenia. Our first drop of coffee was poured out to customers in 2015, and there was no looking back ever since. We now operate 22 branches across the country. Our unique combination of quality, an unmatched menu serving over 120 varieties of drinks along with our experienced baristas makes us stand out among the rest. People engage in conversation, for it is there that news is communicated and where those interested in politics criticize the government in all freedom and without being fearful, since the government does not heed what the people say. The coffeehouses were great social levelers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism. The rich intellectual atmosphere of early London coffeehouses were available to anyone who could pay the sometimes one penny entry fee, giving them the name of 'Penny Universities'. </p>
